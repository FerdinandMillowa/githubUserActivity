# GitHub User Activity CLI

A professional Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that fetches and displays real-time activity for any GitHub user. Built as the second project in my **Backend Development Roadmap**.

## 🚀 The Challenge
The goal of this project was to move beyond local files and interface with a real-world API. 

### Key Learning Objectives:
* **API Integration:** Using Python's `urllib` to fetch data from the GitHub REST API.
* **JSON Parsing:** Navigating complex, nested JSON data structures.
* **Error Handling:** Managing API-specific errors like `404 Not Found` (invalid users) and connection issues.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built entirely using Python's standard library.

## 🛠️ Usage
Run the script from your terminal by providing a GitHub username as an argument:

```bash
python github_activity.py <username>
```
